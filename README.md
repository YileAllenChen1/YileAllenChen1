### Howdy, I'm Yile (Allen) Chen 👋

I am a Junior Computer Engineering Honors Student at [Texas A&M University (TAMU)](https://www.tamu.edu/), with a passion to explore different technologies in computer science/engineering. In the past I have worked on various projects including web development, robotics and machine learning. As a member of [TAMU Robomasters](https://www.tamurobomasters.com/), I have worked on the embedded systems team and computer vision team. Currently I am working under my advisor [Dr. Hu Xia](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/xiahu/index.html) on anomaly detection.
